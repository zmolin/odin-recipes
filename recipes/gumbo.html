    <h2>Making the Gumbo:</h2>
    <p>Cooking time: An hour minimum, but preferably 3-4 hours</p>
    <p>Add 2-3 hours if you make your own chicken broth</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the Roux</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Making roux is imperative for creole dishes as it provides the texture</li>
                <li>In a heated sauce pan, add a 1:1 ratio of butter and flour</li>
                <li>Constantly whisk to prevent burning until it looks like a dark peanut butter chocolate</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Mise-en-place the trinity and prepare vegetables</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If you wish to add fresh cayenne pepper, I recommend a julienne cut for texture</li>
                <li>Despite Disney's beliefs, you <strong>cannot</strong> substitute kale for okra. That is not correct</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Boil the shrimp, brown the sausage, cook the chicken</li>
        <li>Begin a boil of chicken broth in your stock pot</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If you have time and effort I 100% recommend making your own chicken broth</li>
                <li>To do so, prepare veg well in advance and buy a full chicken to carve</li>
                <li>Add veg scraps (e.g. celery scraps), chicken fat, and salt to water. Simmer 1-2 hours</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Add your bay leaves, parsley, garlic, file' and cayenne</li>
            <ul>
                <li>You only need 4-5 bay leaves for a batch. A little goes a long way!</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Add aromatics and protein as your stock heats up</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Now is a great time to incorporate seasonings. It is also hard to overseason so be generous</li>
                <li>Your stock should cover ingredients by 2-3 inches initially</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Add a whiskful of roux and stir until thick</li>
            <ul>
                <li>As you stir your roux in it will begin to thicken into a somewhat sludgy texture. This is good</li>
                <li>Reminder: You can always add more... But it's near impossible to take out too much</li>
            </ul>
        <li>As the broth hits a boil, drop the temperature to a smile and cover</li>
        <li>Cook for however long you have time for</li>
            <ul>
                <li>At minimum cook for an hour. I suggest 3-4 however if given time</li>
                <li>Remember to season and taste as time passes on</li>
            </ul>
        <li>With about 30 minutes to go, cook the rice</li>
            <ul>
                <li>I recommend 1.5 portions of water per portion of rice</li>
                <li>If you want to ramp up your rice, add butter, salt, pepper, and paprika</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Serve gumbo over hot rice and add green onion for garnish</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Don't forget to pick out the bay leaves - they are purely for taste and are inedible</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
